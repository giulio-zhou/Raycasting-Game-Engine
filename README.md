# Raycasting Game Engine

This program uses the technique of raycasting to the render a 2D grid as an interactive 3D map. By default, the walls are rendered with a shadow effect (as if the player is the light source) and the maze is generated randomly. More features to come soon!

To run the program, simply execute `make`.
Here is a real-time demo of the engine.
